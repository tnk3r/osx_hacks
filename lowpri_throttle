#LOW PRIORITY I/O THROTTLE DISABLER. 

'The OSX Performance Unlocker'

I've never seen such performance come from only one kernel parameter.
It's like Apple is making their software more effcienct on lower
performance systems ie: Air/Ipad/mini, etc, by throttling resource heavy processes,

check what is getting throttled:

sudo fs_usage | grep THROTTLED


check parameter:

sysctl debug.lowpri_throttle_enabled


test parameter:

sudo sysctl -w debug.lowpri_throttle_enabled=0



set permanent:

sudo sh -c 'echo debug.lowpri_throttle-enabled=0 >> /etc/sysctl.conf'



and a video showing the process:
