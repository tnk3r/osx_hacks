#LOW PRIORITY I/O THROTTLE DISABLER. 

'The OSX Performance Unlocker'

I've never seen such performance come from only one kernel parameter.
It's like Apple is making their software slower on purpose for more effciency on lower
performance systems ie: Air/Ipad/mini, etc

I need every bit of power OSX has to offer. 



check what it geting throttled:

sudo fs_usage | grep THROTTLED




check parameter:

sysctl -a | grep throttle_enabled




test parameter:

sudo sysctl -w debug.lowpri_throttle_enabled=0



set permanent:

sudo sh -c 'echo debug.lowpri_throttle-enabled=0 >> /etc/sysctl.conf'
